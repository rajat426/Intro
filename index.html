    I do various computer jobs including programming, web development, app development, game designing, graphic designing and many more. At the Lovely Proffesional University, I learned the importance of applying computer science techniques to modern era strategies from experts in the field, including her Online course professor, Dr. Angela Yu. Recently I had finished an online course on web development and learned totally to create a website. I am currently starting my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and hopes to enjoy and learn a lot in LPU's coding clubs in the near future.
